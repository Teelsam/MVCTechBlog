## Description 

Here we have an example of a techblog using the fundamentals of SQL and handlebars frontend framework. MVC is a way of organizing code by purpose. Models (database data schemas), Views (Front end content(html,css)) and Controller(API routes). These organizational fundamentals are a tricky but useful way of working with multiple files. Here we have to pay attention to how to connect all these seperate files into a working whole.

## Installation
Cloning the repo and running `npm install`in the terminal will give you the packages needed to run the code.

Next, running `Node server.js` should run the code allowing us to see the blog in action. 

## Usage

On the blog you can create an account and see the previously written blog posts, as well as post your own! Sojourn around the site and see what treasures can be found~!
